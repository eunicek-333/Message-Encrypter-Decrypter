Encryption is the process by which the original message(plaintext) is converted to an unreadable(ciphertext) form to prevent unauthorized parties from reading it.

Decryption is the process of converting an encrypted message back to its original (readable) format.

This process of Encryption and Decryption is called as "Cryptography".

Key:A key in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, can encode or decode data.

There are different methods for utilizing keys:

1.Symmetric cryptography:refers to the practice of the same key being used for both encryption and decryption.

2.Asymmetric cryptography:refers to the practice of using separate keys for encrypting and decrypting.

'Since the key protects the confidentiality and integrity of the data/system, it is important to be kept secret from unauthorized parties.'

This Project demonstrates the encryption and decryption of data using symmentric cryptography
